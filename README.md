# LEARNER Project
LEARNER aims to expand the applicability of mobile robotic platforms and provide a hybrid solution between model-based and AI-based approaches for addressing current challenges in mobile SLAM and Path Planning, specifically targeting dynamic conditions and constantly changing environments populated by humans.

This repository serves as a means for publishing the code of the developed methods, allowing further exploitation of its functionalities and results.
